## Description

This repository contains code used for my project: *Accelerating Search for Superconductors using Machine Learning*. 

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** is required. You can check your Python version using:

  ```bash
  python3 --version

## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/adigasuhas/Accelerating-Search-for-Superconductors-using-Machine-Learning.git
  ```

- Download the trained models from Google Drive: [Click Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18K2BYny9yomTUyySdaZeJ_XK9qTRr3u4?usp=drive_link)

- Ensure to rename the unzipped folder as `Machine_Learning_Models`.

- Move the `Machine_Learning_Models` folder to the cloned repository:

  ```bash
  mv Machine_Learning_Models Accelerating-Search-for-Superconductors-using-Machine-Learning/
  ```

- Navigate to the code directory where the Tc prediction scripts are located:

  ```bash
  cd Accelerating-Search-for-Superconductors-using-Machine-Learning/Temp_Predictor/
  ```
## Preparing the Input File

- Open the file named `Material_prediction.csv`.
- The following columns can be handled as described:

    - `Material-ID` (_Optional_): This is for user reference and identification. It is not auto-filled by the code, so you may enter any identifier (e.g., Unique Identification number, Sample name).
    - `Chemical_Formula`: Add the materials (chemical compositions) for which you wish to predict the critical temperature ($T_c$).
    - `Temp_critical`(_Optional_): If known, you may enter the experimental $T_c$ here for comparison. Otherwise, you may leave it blank.
      
- Follow the formatting rules illustrated in the reference image provided in the repository to ensure your chemical composition input is valid.

## Compound Similarity Check

- After entering the `Chemical_Formula` into `Material_prediction.csv`, you can check if the compound is present in the `SuperCon-MTG` dataset by running the following command. A warning will be displayed, and if the compound is found, its corresponding material ID and critical temperature will be shown.

    ```bash
    cd Temp_Predictor
    python3 Compound_Matcher.py
    ```

## Generating Descriptors and Critical Temperature Prediction

- Once you have validated that the compound is not present in the `SuperCon-MTG` dataset, you can proceed to generate descriptors for $T_c$ prediction. To do this, simply run the `Predict.sh` script, which will generate the descriptors and predict $T_c$ using both the 30-feature and 5-feature models. 

    If the script does not have execute permissions, you can grant them using the following command (skip if already granted):

    ```bash
    chmod +700 Predict.sh
    ./Predict.sh
    ```

- Upon successful execution, a `Material_prediction_results.csv` file will be generated inside the `Temp_Predictor` folder. This file will contain the following columns:
  - `Material-ID`
  - `Chemical_Formula`
  - `Temp_critical`
  - `Predicted_class`
  - `Predicted_Temp_critical_30_Features`
  - `Predicted_Temp_critical_5_Features`
